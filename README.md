# Perlin Noise Generative Art

Above is a program designed to generate art simulating projectiles reacting to a vector field. Some number of projectiles are placed at each edge of the canvas, at which point they are fired in order to produce the patterns of their movement.  

Several steps are taken in order to generate a vector field suitable for producing consistent patterns. Firstly, an array is generated
